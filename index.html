							<h2>Hello, Mark</h2>
							<p>I hope the flux capacitors in your care are working well and the hyperdrive in your ship is finely tuned, because this is going to be a crazy ride. that's right, we're going to do some old fashioned time travel. It might not be anything like what
								you have nowadays (or then-a-days, I suppose), but here it is nonetheless. We're going to use a letter—that's right, one of those really old things that people used to use to communicate. With what is I'm sure the 12th or so iteration of whatever
								email becomes, I will presume that letters are no longer in use. 
							</p>
							<p>Perhaps, however, the great machine uprising that I have long suspected will have made letters again the preferred and most-effective form of communication. 
							</p>
							<p>In either case, this letter is what we shall use for this. What is 'this' you ask? I've already told you—pay more attention. It is old-fashioned time travel. It's more like time traversal, really, but we won't need to get caught up in semantics. 
							</p>
							<p>One care I do want to express before we begin is that I do really hope you can read this; unless there is some incredibly disruptive event or another linguistically-dynamic happening, English shouldn't be all that different. But one cannot know? 
							</p>
							<p>At long last we can begin. Welcome, mark, to the year 2014. Yes, it may seem a long time ago. I do not know what has transpired from this moment to your present one, but I want to impart to you some things that will not. Yes, I'm sure the future
								is "pretty cool" as we used to say in my/our day. Maybe you're reading this on your iPhone 24 or perhaps some implanted meta-cognitive device. But no matter how the times have changed, I want to pass to you truths that I know will not change,
								as well as some good advice for people as crazy as us.

							<h2>Remember</h2>
<p>I am writing this from the Cornerstone Coffee shop at Azusa Pacific University. I am drinking coffee, eating a muffin, and doing some pretty simple time-traversal. 
	</p>
<p>-Remember to take time to sit in a place with coffee and ponder, pray, and play. Never succumb to the mental inertia and sluggishness that is so common in this world. At the same time, never cease in praying. You will never regret spending more time with The Lord in prayer. Pray at home, pray in the quiet place. But also pray and think with God in the public places, for our God is not confined. 
	</p>
<p>-Remember to thank the Lord always for the beauty and joys of life. This semester, as I graduate, I have been more thankful for the small moments and tried to enjoy them more. Take a moment to enjoy every particular configuration of the world, as every one is unique and passing.
	</p>
<p>-In the same way, remember these moments in the busyness, because life will only get busier and busier, it is crucial that you build good habits and utilize them later in life. Trials will come, and you will need to rely on a foundation that the Lord will use to preserve you through trials. 
	</p>
<p>-Remember to always laugh and deeply enjoy every moment that you can. Not all moments will be light, but you can still find ways to enjoy many, many of them and laugh while you’re doing it.

							<h2>Commencing practice</h2>
							<p>From that excellent work, "Scenes in the Practice of a New York Surgeon," by Dr. E. H. Dixon, I copy, with some abbreviation, the following, which the author terms "Leaves from the Log-book of an Unfledged Æsculapian:"--</p>

							<p>"In the year 1830 I was sent forth, like our long-suffering and much-abused prototype,--old father Noah's crow,--from the ark of safety, the old St. Duane Street College. I pitched my tent, and set up my trap, in what was then a fashionable up-town
								street.</p>

							<p>"I hired a modest house, and had my arm-chair, my midnight couch, and my few books in my melancholy little office, and I confess that I now and then left an amputating-knife, or some other awful-looking instrument, on the table, to impress the
								poor women who came to me for advice.</p>

							<p>"These little matters, although the 'Academy' would frown upon them, I considered quite pardonable. God knows I would willingly have adopted their most approved method of a splendid residence, and silver-mounted harnesses for my bays; but they
								were yet in dream-land, eating moonbeams, and my vicious little nag had nearly all this time to eat his oats and nurse his bad temper in his comfortable stable.</p>

							<p>"In this miserable way I read over my old books, watered my rose-bushes,--sometimes with tears,--drank my tea and ate my toast, and occasionally listened to the complaint of an unfortunate Irish damsel, with her customary account of 'a pain in
								me side an' a flutterin' about me heart.' At rare intervals I ministered to some of her countrywomen in their fulfilment of the great command when placed in the Garden of Eden. (What a dirty place it would have been if inhabited by Irish women!)</p>

							<p>"And thus I spent nearly a year without a single call to any person of character. I think I should have left in despair if it had not been for a lovely creature up the street. She was the wife of a distinguished fish merchant down town.</p>

							<p>"This lovely woman was Mrs. Mackerel. I will explain how it was that I was summoned to her ladyship's mansion, and had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Mackerel, of the firm of 'Mackerel, Haddock &amp; Dun.'</p>

							<p>"One bitter cold night in January, just as I was about to retire, a furious ring at the front door made me feel particularly amiable! A servant announced the sudden and alarming illness of Mrs. Mackerel, with the assurance that as the family physician
								was out of town, Mrs. M. would be obliged if I would immediately visit her. Accordingly, I soon found myself in the presence of the accomplished lady, having--I confess it--given my hair an extra touch as I entered the beautiful chamber.</p>

							<p>"Mrs. Mackerel was not a bad-tempered lady; she was only a beautiful fool--nothing less, dear reader, or she would have never married old Mackerel. Her charms would have procured her a husband of at least a tolerable exterior. His physiognomy presented
								a remarkable resemblance to his namesake. Besides, he chewed and smoked, and the combination of the aroma of his favorite luxuries with the articles of his merchandise must have been most uncongenial to the curve of such lips and such nostrils
								as Mrs. Mackerel's.</p>

							<p>"I was received by Mr. Mackerel in a manner that increased observation has since taught me is sufficiently indicative of the hysterical _finale_ of a domestic dialogue. He was not so obtuse as to let me directly into the true cause of his wife's
								nervous attack and his own collectedness, and yet he felt it would not answer to make too light of it before me.</p>

							<p>"Mr. and Mrs. M. had just returned from a party. (The party must be the 'scape-goat'!) He assured me that as the lady was in the full enjoyment of health previously, he felt obliged to attribute the cause of her attack and speechless condition--for
								she spoke not one word, or gave a sign--to the dancing, heated room, and the supper.</p>

							<p>"I was fully prepared to realize the powers of ice-cream, cake, oranges, chicken-salad, oysters, sugar-plums, punch, and champagne, and at one moment almost concluded to despatch a servant for an emetic of ipecac; but--I prudently avoided it. Aside
								from the improbability of excess of appetite through the portal of such a mouth, the lovely color of the cheeks and lips utterly forbade a conclusion favorable to Mr. Mackerel's solution of the cause.</p>

							<p>"I placed my finger on her delicate and jewelled wrist. All seemed calm as the thought of an angel's breast!

								<p>"I was nonplussed. 'Could any tumultuous passion ever have agitated that bosom so gently swelling in repose?'</p>

								<p>"Mackerel's curious questions touching my sagacity as to his wife's condition received about as satisfactory a solution as do most questions put to me on the cause and treatment of diseases; and having tolerably befogged him with opinions, and
									lulled his suspicions to rest, by the apparent innocent answers to his leading questions, he arrived at the conclusion most desirable to him, viz., that I was a fool--a conviction quite necessary in some nervous cases....</p>

								<p>"So pleased was Mr. M. with the soothing influences of my brief visit that he very courteously waited on me to the outside door, instead of ordering a servant to show me out, and astonished me by desiring me to call on the patient again in the
									morning.</p>

								<p>"After my usual diversion of investigating 'a pain an' a flutterin' about me heart,' and an 'O, I'm kilt intirely,' I visited Mrs. Mackerel, and had the extreme pleasure of finding her quite composed, and in conversation with her fashionable friend,
									Mrs. Tiptape. The latter was the daughter of a 'retired milliner,' and had formed a desirable union with Tiptape, the eminent dry goods merchant. Fortunately--for she was a woman of influence--I passed the critical examination of Mrs. T. unscathed
									by her sharp black eyes, and, as the sequel will show, was considered by her 'quite an agreeable person.'</p>

								<p>"Poor Mrs. Mackerel, notwithstanding her efforts to conceal it, had evidently received some cruel and stunning communication from her husband on the night of my summons; her agitated circulation during the fortnight of my attendance showed to
									my conviction some persistent and secret cause for her nervousness.</p>

								<p>"One evening she assured me that she felt she should now rapidly recover, as Mr. Mackerel had concluded to take her to Saratoga. I, of course, acquiesced in the decision, though my previous opinion had not been asked. I took a final leave of the
									lovely woman, and the poor child soon departed for Saratoga.</p>

								<p>"The ensuing week there was a sheriff's sale at Mackerel's residence. The day following the Mackerels' departure, Mr. Tiptape did me the honor to inquire after the health of my family; and a week later, Master Tiptape having fallen and bumped
									his dear nose on the floor, I had the felicity of soothing the anguish of his mamma in her magnificent _boudoir_, and holding to her lovely nose the smelling salts, and offering such consolation as her trying position required!"</p>

								<p>Thus was commenced the practice of one of the first physicians of New York. The facts are avouched for. The names, of course, are manufactured, to cover the occupation of the parties. The doctor still lives, in the enjoyment of a lucrative and
									respectable practice, and the love and confidence of his numerous friends and patrons.</p>

								<p>Quite as ludicrous scenes could be revealed by most physicians, if they would but take the time to think over their earlier efforts, and the various circumstances which were mainly instrumental in getting them into a respectable practice.</p>
