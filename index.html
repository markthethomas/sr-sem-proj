							<h2>Hello, Mark</h2>
							<p>I hope the flux capacitors in your care are working well and the hyperdrive in your ship is finely tuned, because this is going to be a crazy ride. that's right, we're going to do some old fashioned time travel. It might not be anything like what
								you have nowadays (or then-a-days, I suppose), but here it is nonetheless. We're going to use a letter—that's right, one of those really old things that people used to use to communicate. With what is I'm sure the 12th or so iteration of whatever
								email becomes, I will presume that letters are no longer in use. 
							</p>
							<p style="float: right;">
								<img src="images/mcfly_s-ride-1.jpg" alt="" width="300px" />
							</p>
							<p>Perhaps, however, the great machine uprising that I have long suspected will have made letters again the preferred and most-effective form of communication. 
							</p>
							<p>In either case, this letter is what we shall use for this. What is 'this' you ask? I've already told you—pay more attention. It is old-fashioned time travel. It's more like time traversal, really, but we won't need to get caught up in semantics. 
							</p>
							<p>One care I do want to express before we begin is that I do really hope you can read this; unless there is some incredibly disruptive event or another linguistically-dynamic happening, English shouldn't be all that different. But one cannot know? 
							</p>
							<p>At long last we can begin. Welcome, mark, to the year 2014. Yes, it may seem a long time ago. I do not know what has transpired from this moment to your present one, but I want to impart to you some things that will not. Yes, I'm sure the future
								is "pretty cool" as we used to say in my/our day. Maybe you're reading this on your iPhone 24 or perhaps some implanted meta-cognitive device. But no matter how the times have changed, I want to pass to you truths that I know will not change,
								as well as some good advice for people as crazy as us. 
							</p>

							<p>
								--love, Mark @22

							<h2>Remember</h2>
							<p>I am writing this from the Cornerstone Coffee shop at Azusa Pacific University. I am drinking coffee, eating a muffin, and doing some pretty simple time-traversal. 
							</p>
							<p>-Remember to take time to sit in a place with coffee and ponder, pray, and play. Never succumb to the mental inertia and sluggishness that is so common in this world. At the same time, never cease in praying. You will never regret spending more
								time with The Lord in prayer. Pray at home, pray in the quiet place. But also pray and think with God in the public places, for our God is not confined. 
							</p>
							<p>-Remember to thank the Lord always for the beauty and joys of life. This semester, as I graduate, I have been more thankful for the small moments and tried to enjoy them more. Take a moment to enjoy every particular configuration of the world,
								as every one is unique and passing.
							</p>
							<p>-In the same way, remember these moments in the busyness, because life will only get busier and busier, it is crucial that you build good habits and utilize them later in life. Trials will come, and you will need to rely on a foundation that the
								Lord will use to preserve you through trials. 
							</p>
							<p>-Remember to always laugh and deeply enjoy every moment that you can. Not all moments will be light, but you can still find ways to enjoy many, many of them and laugh while you’re doing it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Remember not to take youself too seriously. You used to hate those people who handled themselves that way.
							</p>
							<p>
								Remember the Gospel in everything.
							</p>
							<p><b>
									For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.” (Romans 1:17 ESV)
								</b>

							<h2>Here's to the crazy ones</h2>

							<p>Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree
								with them, glorify or vilify them. But the only thing you can’t do is ignore them.</p>
							<p>Because they change things. They invent. They imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward. Maybe they have to be crazy.</p>
							<p>How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels? We make tools for these kinds of people.</p>
							<p>While some see them as the crazy ones, you should see see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.</p>
